Welcome to the Go Book
**********************

This humble work (in progress) is an online book for learning the Go Programming
Language (golang) - It is meant for anyone interested in Go, and aims to be easy
and fun to read --despite my weak English.

You can read it online at: http://go-book.appspot.com 

It is written in reStructuredText and the rendering is done with Sphinx.

Your feedback is really appreciated :)
