This humble work was and is still being done on vim_ using Sphinx_ with the help
of Graphviz_ (for the various drawings and diagrams) and some tea as the
author's fuel.

The font used for the titles is `Rancho Regular`_ released by `Sideshow`_ under
the `Apache License, version 2.0`_

The examples provided in this book are in public domain. You can do whatever you
want with them and I claim no responsibility over their use. Just leave me
alone.

The whole work is produced in HTML5, and I don't care if your browser is old.
It's easier for you to upgrade your browser than for me to rewrite the template
used to generate this. I don't care :)

The Go gopher was drawn by `Renée French`_, the artist who also made Glenda_
the `Plan 9`_ bunny.

Your pull requests for new content, typos, better ideas... are more than
welcome! If you want to translate this work, please let me know, I'd love to
share your translation here too.

A little request, and I know most of you won't do it anyway. But I'd hate it if
this work was copied and pasted to spam search engines and make money out of it.
Really.

I, `Big Yuuta`_, am the author and the maintainer of this project, and despite
my weak English, I'm doing my best to keep it fun and -I hope- useful for people
wanting to learn Go.

*But* I wouldn't be able to do this alone. In fact, I'd like to thank these
people from the bottom of my heart.

- `Wayne E. Seguin`_: This man is a real *machine*, he reviewed everything,
  asked questions, suggested, and corrected many sentences, gave me some great
  advice... And added more fun and humor to the whole thing. Wayne, you rock!

- `Adam (hammerandtongs)`_: Thank you so much for those many spelling and
  grammar fixes!

- `Calvin (csmcanarney)`_: Thanks for being the first to give a hand and for
  your fixes.

- The whole golang-nuts_ community for their support and cheers, and the huge
  amount of inspiration and ideas they share everyday in that group.
