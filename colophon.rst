This humble work was and is still being done on vim_ using Sphinx_ with the help
of Graphviz_ (for the various drawings and diagrams) and some tea as the
author's fuel.

The font used for the titles is `Rancho Regular`_ released by `Sideshow`_ under
the `Apache License, version 2.0`_

The examples provided in this book are in public domain. You can do whatever you
want with them and I claim no responsability over their use. Just leave me
alone.

The whole work is produced in HTML5, and I don't care if your browser is old.
It's easier for you to upgrade your browser than for me to rewrite the template
used to generate this. I don't care :)

The Go gopher was drawn by `Renée French`_, the artist who also made Glenda_
the `Plan 9`_ bunny.

Your pull requests for new content, typos, better ideas... are more than

A little request, and I know most of you won't do it anyway. But I'd hate it if
this work is copyied/pasted to spam search engines and make money out of it.
Really.
