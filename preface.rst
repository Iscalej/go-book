Preface
*******
Go_ is a programming language created by a team of *very* talented folks at
Google_ with the help of many people from the Open Source community. Its source
code is itself open sourced and available to see and modify freely. 

This book will try to teach you how to write some code in Go, while having fun
doing so. It comes with many illustrative examples and diagrams in order to make
the studied concepts easy to understand.

Why Go?
=======
There are gazzilions (not that much actually) programming languages already in
the wild. So one could, very rightly, ask why yet another language?
The fact is Go is easy to grok, and fun to use but also efficient and well
designed. 

Go is a compiled language, that is a language that produces machine code that
can be executed without the need of an external interpreter like python, ruby,
perl and others.

In fact, if we were to compare Go to something, it would be a modern C. Yes,
that's a strong statement that calls for a justification. Being a C programmer
myself, C has its very own dear place in my heart, a place that won't shared by
anything else. But Go earned my and many people respect thanks to its
simplicity, efficience and smart concepts that this book aims to demonstrate.

Go comes with some new syntax and idioms but not too much. Enough to make things
evolve, and not too much to avoid alienating people who are used to some other
programming languages. This balance, and -I'd dare to say- *minimalism* are what
makes Go fun to learn.

Go has the efficiency of statically-typed languages, yet it provides some easy
syntax and concepts that make it as *cool* as dynamic languages.

Go programs are compiled fast, and run fast. Go also supports natively
concurrency and communication.

Why this book?
==============
This modest work is an introduction to the Go language, it is meant to be easy
to read by everyone. Yet tries to make this learning experience fun and easy.
Yes, that's quite a challenge, but... *aude aliquid dignum!* [#f1]_.

I, personnaly, don't buy into the *"learn the hard way"* methods. Learning
shouldn't be *hard*! Just remember that we've learnt how to speak while
playing when we were younger and stupider. And Go, or any other language for
that matter, is actually a lot easier than any spoken language ; there are fewer
words, fewer syntax rules, fewer idoms...

So here's the deal and the only condition for learning with this book: take it
easy. Really, consider it as a game.

We will play with data and code, learn something new every time. There will be
some diversity, from simple, or even silly things, to some very serious and
smart concepts. 

Also, almost -if not all- the provided programs can be tested online in the `Go
Playground`_ simply by copying/pasting them there.

A work in progress
==================
This is a personal initiative, I have no deadlines with any publisher. I do this
for fun, and during my free time. I will strive to improve it as much as I can.
I don't claim to be *perfect* ---no one is! 

So your help, criticism, suggestions are more than welcome. And the more you
contribute, the better it will be. 

Thanks for your attention, and have fun!
